# adaptive-systems-research
Jordan Townsends PDFs for ArVIx any domain

This repository hosts preprint research papers and supporting material developed by Jordan Townsend under the Adaptive Systems Research program.

The work spans multiple domains, including:
- Adaptive matter–information systems
- Non-equilibrium physical–computational architectures
- Information–interaction unification frameworks
- Machine-learned dynamic materials
- Photon–atom cascading systems
- Continuous self-learning architectures
- Human-state–coupled computational control systems

These papers explore systems in which matter, information, time, learning, and human state are treated as continuously adaptive components within unified non-equilibrium frameworks.
